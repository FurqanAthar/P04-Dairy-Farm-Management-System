# Dairy Management System

This is a dairy management system developed as a final year project using the MERN stack. The system is designed to be a multi-tenant, Platform as a Service (PaaS) software, allowing anyone to register and use the system.

## Key Features

### Multi-Tenant:

The system allows for multiple tenants to register and use the system, each with their own isolated data.

### User-Friendly Interface:

The system has a user-friendly interface that allows users to add details of their animals, track milk production, manage daily expenses and incomes, and inventory in their farm.

### Trend Analysis:

The system allows for displaying trends according to expenses, incomes, and animals' milk production.

### Employee Management:

The system allows users to add other employees to manage farm details.

### Data Isolation:

The system ensures data isolation between tenants, meaning that each tenant has completely isolated data from other tenants.

## Development Process

### Requirements Gathering:

Before starting the development, a thorough analysis was done, a whole application architecture, class diagrams, and use cases were made. The Requirements and Architecture folders have the documents related to this process.

### Sprint Model:

Using a sprint model, new features were added in each sprint. The Management folder contains the biweekly meetings we had with our instructors and the details regarding the next feature we will be implementing.

### Development:

The Development folder has the code related to each sprint. The Prototype folder used to have the latest development code and the new features we kept on adding with time. It has both the frontend and the backend. The whole development was linked to this folder and the code related to each sprint was pushed into respective sprint folders for marking.

### Testing:

The Testing folder has the document related to the tests we carried out on our application for any potential bugs. We tested our application by giving inputs, recording them in the document, and then marked their status as if the test case has been passed or not. A thorough testing was done.
